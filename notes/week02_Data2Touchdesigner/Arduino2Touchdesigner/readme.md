# TouchDesigner Firmata Interface

This project provides an interface between TouchDesigner and Arduino using the Firmata protocol. It allows TouchDesigner to communicate with Arduino boards for physical computing applications, interactive installations, and creative projects that bridge the digital and physical worlds.

## Overview

The TouchDesigner-Firmata interface enables:
- Reading analog and digital inputs from sensors connected to Arduino
- Controlling digital outputs (LEDs, relays, etc.)
- Driving PWM outputs (for LED brightness, servo motors, etc.)
- Creating interactive physical computing projects with TouchDesigner's real-time capabilities

## Requirements

- [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/) (Latest stable version recommended)
- Arduino UNO or compatible board
- Arduino IDE (for uploading the Firmata firmware)
- Basic electronic components as needed (breadboard, LEDs, resistors, sensors, etc.)

## Installation

### Arduino Setup

1. Connect your Arduino board to your computer
2. Open Arduino IDE
3. Upload the StandardFirmata sketch to your Arduino:
   - Go to File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata
   - Upload to your Arduino board
   - Note the COM port your Arduino is connected to

### TouchDesigner Setup

1. Open the `Touchdesigner_firmata_base.toe` file in TouchDesigner
2. In the Firmata DAT node, set the correct COM port for your Arduino
3. The connection status should show "Connected" if everything is working correctly

## Basic Circuit Setup

The included diagrams show a basic setup with:
- An Arduino UNO connected to a breadboard
- Several wired components including:
  - LEDs with current-limiting resistors
  - A potentiometer
  - A button
  - Power and ground connections

Refer to the included circuit diagrams for proper wiring.

## Using the Interface

### In TouchDesigner

- Digital inputs (buttons, switches) will appear as values in the "Digital In" channels
- Analog inputs (potentiometers, sensors) will appear as values in the "Analog In" channels
- Digital outputs can be controlled by setting values in the "Digital Out" channels
- PWM outputs can be controlled with values in the "PWM Out" channels

### Example Operations

1. **Reading a sensor**: Connect an analog sensor to an analog pin and read its value from the corresponding "Analog In" channel
2. **Controlling an LED**: Set a digital output channel to 1 to turn on an LED connected to the corresponding pin
3. **Controlling LED brightness**: Use PWM output to control the brightness of an LED by sending values between 0-255

## Project Structure

- `Touchdesigner_firmata_base.toe` - TouchDesigner project file with Firmata interface
- `StandardFirmata.ino` - Arduino firmware that enables Firmata communication
- `LICENSE.txt` - GNU Lesser General Public License

## Customizing the Project

You can extend this base project by:
- Adding more sensors and actuators to the Arduino
- Creating custom TouchDesigner interfaces to visualize sensor data
- Using sensor data to drive generative graphics or audio
- Creating interactive installations with physical controls

## Troubleshooting

- If no connection is established, check that the correct COM port is selected
- Make sure the StandardFirmata sketch is properly uploaded to the Arduino
- Check wiring connections and ensure components are properly connected
- Verify that the Arduino is powered (USB or external power)
